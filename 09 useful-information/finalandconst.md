### Final Vs Const In Dart
If you do not want to change the value of a variable, then you can use either final or const in dart. 

### Example 
```dart
void main() {
  final finalName = "Final John Doe";
  const constName = "Const John Doe";

  finalName = "Raj"; // Not Possible
  constName = "Anu"; // Not Possible

  print("Final name is " + finalName);
  print("Const name is " + constName);
}

```

````plaintext
Error: Can't assign to the final variable 'finalName'.
Error: Can't assign to the const variable 'constName'.

### Const In Dart
If you need to calculate value at compile-time, it is a good idea to choose `const` over `final.` A const variable is a compile-time constant. They must be created from data that can be calculated at compile time. `100+1` is valid const expression but `const date = DateTime.now();` is not. 


### What Is Compile Time
When you run code in the dart, it will be `compiled` into the format that the machine can understand. This time is called compile time. Const value should be known at compile time.

### What Is Run Time
Runtime is the time when your compiled code is started running. It generally occurs after the compile time.

Note:  If you use `const` inside the class, declare it as `static const.`
{{% /notice %}}

```dart
const total = 50+50; // Possible
const date = DateTime.now(); // Not Possible

```
### Advantage Of Constant
- Improve Performance

### Final In Dart
If the value is calculated at runtime, you can choose final for it. For. e.g if you want to calculate date on run time, you can use `final date = DateTime.now();` but not `const date = DateTime.now();`.

Note: Anything that is unknown at compile time should be `final` over `const.`
{{% /notice %}}

```dart
final date = DateTime.now(); // Possible
const date = DateTime.now(); // Not Possible
```


### When To Use Const
- If you know the value at compile-time, choose `const` for e.g. `const a = 100;`.



### When To Use Final
- If you don't know the value at compile-time, choose `final`.
- If you want a network request that can't be changed, choose  `final`.
- If you want to get some values from the database, choose `final`.
- If you want to read a local file, choose `final`.

Note: Final variables will have a value known at runtime. Const variables have a value known at compile time. Instance variable can be final but not const.
