1. What is the purpose of the **?** operator in Dart null safety?
2. Create a **late** variable named **address**, assign a **US** value to it and print it.
3. How do you declare a nullable type in Dart null safety?
4. Write a program in a dart to create an age variable and assign a **null** value to it using **?**.
5. Write a function that accepts a nullable int parameter and returns 0 if the value is null using null coalescing operator **??**.
6. Write a function named **generateRandom()** in dart that randomly returns **100** or **null**. Also, assign a return value of the function to a variable named **status** that can't be null. Give status a default value of 0, if **generateRandom()** function returns null.
